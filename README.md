## Key takeaways:
- Ubiquity across states is a marketing point in terms of comparison
- On the ground realities and legal issues play into moving towards full participation
- There are clear regional differences in the country
- Students and parents in New Jersey are in need of a qualifying test for High School graduation
- New Jersey is the 11th largest state - small percentages gains here are large total gains

## Next Steps & Additional Data Analysis
- Existing customer demographic information
- Graduation requirements per state
- Socioeconomic information of SAT test takers
- Destinations for test-takers & list of colleges that accept/don't accept SAT
-  Marketing push based on this information
